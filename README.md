<h2> About </h2>
My name is Mark. I was born in Sydney and come from an Italian background, through which I can speak a bit of the language. I completed my first five years of schooling in Sydney before I moved to Griffith in regional NSW, which is where I stayed until completing my HSC in 2015. Before I started my current employed as a Health Information Officer at a private hospital in Melbourne, I worked at two separate petrol stations as a customer service attendant and while I've enjoyed all my work so far, it's not something I see myself doing for the rest of my life, which is why I've decided to pursue IT.

  <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
  I have always had a strong interest in the IT field, which basically started when I was a little kid playing basic flash games on my parentâ€™s computer. Over time, this basic interest became stronger and lead me to taking IT based electives in high school and eventually onto starting a Diploma of IT. Adding to that being from a fairly tech-savvy family definitely contributed to my interest. I would say my main interests in IT would definitely be network security and programming AI, especially for robots.

I want to study with RMIT because I believe they can offer me one of the best looked upon qualifications in the professional world, which would in turn increase my job prospects as I look to build a career for myself in the world of cyber security and more specifically my ideal job as a penetration tester. I thought studying through Open Universities was also a really good option, as it allows me to be flexible with combing study and work.

I expect to learn relevant topics and subjects that will aid me in finding work after my study. Personally, with the interests that I have I would love to go into further depth with programming and networking, as careers in these fields are what I aspire to achieve.
